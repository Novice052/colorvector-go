# Color Vector

A simple utility that given two colors in RBG format and a number of desired intervals, returns an array of colors
evenly distributed between (and including) the two starting colors.

### How the math works:

```Point 1:  (1,2,3)    Point 2:  (5, 0, -1).  
To lay out the points from Point 1 to Point 2,
Subtract (5,0,-1) - (1,2,3) to get the direction vector for the line.  In this case, <4, -2, -4>.

Then create the parametric equation for the line <x,y,z> = t * <4, -2, -4> + <1,2,3>

This set up leads to: 
when t = 0, <x,y,z> = 0* <4, -2, -4> + <1,2,3>  = < 1,2,3 >
when t = 1, <x,y,z> = 1* <4, -2, -4> + <1,2,3>  = < 5,0,-1 >

To distribute points evenly along this interval, distribute t evenly at the fractional size you need.  
For example for 6 points between and including both Point 1 and Point 2, divide into 5ths by letting 
t=0, .2, .4, .6, .8, 1.  ```
